# T-SFuzzyController-using-LMI-MATLAB-byHan
This repository provides the code about the T-S fuzzy controller design with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).<br>
The example system is considered as a truck_trailer system.<br>
This system is linearized into 2 sub systems.

## Simulation Guide
Please run the code based on the following steps.

Step 1. Run the MATLAB code "Simulation_ND."<br>
Step 2. Please refer the uploaded paper [1] to understand the T-S fuzzy system.
